# ToDo App AngularJS

Basic ToDo app created with [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/) and [SASS](https://sass-lang.com/). This project was created over 4 years ago, it was originally to study the angular structures (based on John Papa's articles) and connection with firebase. After some time without updating, I'll discontinue the project and a remake on React will be made.
